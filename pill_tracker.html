					<h2>The Brief</h2>
					<p>Create a web app using only Ruby, Sinatra, PostGre, HTML and CSS  (no bootstrap allowed) to record when someone takes a pill.  So they have a record of it should they forget. </p>

							<h3>The Why</h3>
							<p>This was my first project while studying at Code Clan and we were asked to come up with a project of our own to bring together our newly taught skills in Ruby, Sinatra and PostGre in creating a CRUD app.  I had just under 1 week to complete this app and create a presentation on it.</p>

					</section>
					<section class="feature right">
						<img src="images/pill-pills.png" alt="pill tracker page showing available pills" class="image icon solid" /></a>
						<div class="content">
							<h3>HTML & CSS</h3>
							<p>While HTML and CSS were not part of the course I had to learn most of it as I went along and followed some online guides, YouTube videos and some trial and error until I found something I liked. </p>
							<p>I used the same CSS code as a template for all the cards throughout the app</p>							
						</div>

					<section class="feature left">
						<img src="images/pill-users.png" alt="pill tracker page showing current users" class="image icon solid" /></a>
						<div class="content">
							<h3>but why this?</h3>
							<p>I know a few people that need to take pills regularly and all of them sometimes forget if they have taken a pill or when they took it.</p>
							<p>The aim of the app was so that they could enter in the pills they took and then record when they took the pills.</p>
						</div>
					</section>
					<section class="feature right">
						<img src="images/pill-select.png" alt="pill tracker showing how to select a pill to take" class="image icon solid" /></a>
						<div class="content">
							<h3>Security</h3>
							<p>Despite having multiple users the site has no login to protect the sensitive data from other users.  Any user can click and view someone else or change their details </p>
							<p>Part of the brief I got was to miss this part out and just concentrate on the CRUD functionality instead</p>

					<section class="feature left">
						<img src="images/pill-record.png" alt="pill tracker page showing a record of the pills taken." class="image icon solid" /></a>
						<div class="content">
							<h3>Planning</h3>
							<p>Before any code was even written I started to plan and draw out the SQL tables and how they would be joined.  Then I drew out the rest like a use case diagram and a site map </p>
							<p>For this I used draw.io website and then saved them to my computer.</p>
